# hepm
Hepm is a place to get people to help with your tasks or handle your domestic chores nearby. You can tip them and they can decide to do your task voluntarily.

## Creating a branch

Creating a branch should follow the following pattern:

* New branches should only be created on the `develop` branch

* New branches should follow the naming convention
`[taskname]/feature-name`
* Commits should follow the [conventional-commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) pattern e.g `style: add responsiveness to header for mobile screens`

* All changes should be merged to the `develop` branch in a pull request explaining what the changes entail.
